# üí≥ Financial Loan Dashboard (Tableau)

### üìå Project Overview

The **Financial Loan Dashboard** is an interactive **Tableau-based analytics project** built to analyze loan performance, funding distribution, and repayment behavior across different borrower segments, loan grades, and geographic regions.

This project visualizes the data of a lending organization (modeled after **Lending Club Loan Data**) and provides a **real-time financial performance snapshot**, helping business stakeholders assess loan quality, risk exposure, and funding patterns.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goals of this dashboard are:

* To analyze the **overall loan portfolio performance** by comparing funded amounts, repayments, and issued loans.
* To differentiate between **good loans** (fully paid or on track) and **bad loans** (defaulted or charged-off).
* To visualize loan distribution **by purpose, term, grade, and geography**.
* To identify patterns and trends in loan issuance over time.
* To provide actionable insights for **financial risk analysis** and **decision-making**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation

Data was preprocessed and cleaned before loading into Tableau:

1. **Removed null and duplicate records.**
2. **Standardized date fields** (`Issue_Date`) for trend analysis.
3. **Derived categorical fields**:

   * *Loan Type* = Good Loan / Bad Loan (based on `Loan_Status`).
   * *Year of Issue* extracted from `Issue_Date`.
4. Created **calculated fields** for:

   * `Good Loan %` and `Bad Loan %`
   * `Total Funded Amount` and `Total Payment`
   * Loan term segmentation (`36 months`, `60 months`)
